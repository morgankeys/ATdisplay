= Basic install instructions =

(this needs more work for detail, but should be complete)

1) Throw all the files in one directory.

2) Make sure you have the dependencies installed, and if you've done anything fun like install them in a user directory, you may have to edit the file to include the search paths.

3) Make sure your cron user has write access to tweets.pkl

4) Set up a cron job that will trigger sidisplay1.py. For most Twitter accounts, something like: 
*/1     *	*	*	*	python /home/display/www/sidisplay1.py

should work just fine. You may need to request whitelisting of your Twitter account.
